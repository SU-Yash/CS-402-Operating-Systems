Statistics: 

	average packet inter-arrival time = 0.5556696
	average packet service time = (N/A, no packet served)
	average number of packets in Q1 = 0
	average number of packets in Q2 = 0
	average number of packets in S1 = 0
	average number of packets in S2 = 0

	average time a packet spent in system = (N/A, no packet served)
	standard deviation for time spent in system = (N/A, no packet served)
	token drop probability = 0.875
	packet drop probability = 1
